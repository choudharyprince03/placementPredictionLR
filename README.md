# 🎓 Placement Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts whether a student will be **placed or not** based on academic and other attributes using **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to student placement prediction.  
We use **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset and then train a **Logistic Regression model** to predict placement outcomes.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is `placement.csv` which contains student details such as:
- Academic percentages
- Specialization
- Work experience
- Placement status (Target variable)

> ⚠️ Ensure the dataset is placed in the project root directory as `placement.csv`.

---

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. **Data Loading** – Import dataset using Pandas.  
2. **EDA** – Check missing values, feature distributions, correlations, and visualize placement status.  
3. **Preprocessing** – Encode categorical variables, scale features.  
4. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression model.  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  

---

## 📊 Results
The Logistic Regression model provides:  
- **Accuracy Score** (depends on dataset split)  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Classification Report**
